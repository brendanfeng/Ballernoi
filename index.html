          Click on a player from the court to edit their speed (in miles per hour).
          You can either choose a NBA Player from the list or edit the speed directly.
          Adjusting the time slider will show the distance covered within that time frame
          (between 1 and 2 seconds).

        Welcome to Ballernoi! The basketball court that you see has been split up into a Voronoi
        tessellation. Each small black circle represents a player playing defense, and each region is made up
        of the set of points on the court that are closest to that player (relative to their teammates).
        Each player also has a range of coverage, based on their average speed and represented by the gradient
        around them. Check out how the weak points of the defenses change when you drag the players around,
        change the time frame, or edit the players' speed.
      </p>
      <p class="instructions" id="data-explanation">
        Data is from the 2015-2016 NBA season - more recent data is kept private by Second Spectrum, the NBA's
        current partner for player tracking. Note that players' wingspans or defensive awareness have not been
        taken into account, nor offensive players being obstacles to the defensive players' movements.
